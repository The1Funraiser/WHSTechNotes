3 sensors found on sphero bolt was that bolt consists of compass, light, and infrared sensors.
One of the 3 sensors im going to pick from sphero BOLT is compass. How does the compass sensor work inside sphero BOLT? Well, it basically works like a regular compass that you probably own. Where sphero can find magnetic north on earth. Sphero bolt will spin and automatically sync to the same offset north that your device is pointed to.

For Me: I had no difficulty while doing the journal writing prompts.
For You: I had no challenges while I was doing the journal writing prompts.

Precision can affect the outcome of the program, say you didn't put any effor in it, it will diminish the quality and accuracy. In addition, you do put effort in your work, the quality of it will be greater, and further greater the accuracy.
Missing steps and details can decrease the effort put in the coding and fail at doing the work.
It good to have good habit to be great in paying attention to detail in your early coding journey, because you want to succeed and make it stand out by making it unique.

The 5 P's of Wagner core values consist of polite, productive, prompt, positve, and prepared.
One of the 5 p's I've chosen is prepared. Why did I choose this for one? Its because you have to be prepared on the activities or assignments you will be doing. Being prepared helps you be ready for whats coming on in the future. 
Preparation is able benefit for me while in computer science class. How so? Well I've been doing a lot of the assignments I have gotten to do, and I've been being prepared for the upcoming activites that my teachers will give me.

The 4 C's consist of confident, courageous, consistent, and communicate.
One of the 4 c's I've picked is communicate.Why did I choose this? Its because it can benefit me for if I have any trouble with any of the assignments. Its good to communicate to your classmates or teacher to help you. Say you had a problem with coding, like everytime you ran the programm, it wouldn't work. So, you can tell your teacher that you need help with the problem.

The challenges we faced when making our maze was that we were having issues with the maze. Like it wasn't going where it was post go go, however we soon found out it was the paper. It was in the wrong direction, so thats why it wasn't going inside the lines.

We had to make adjustments to the rotations, and how long it had to travel to reach the other point of the maze. In addition to the maze, we had to rotate the paper, to successfully complete the maze.

What was the hour code activity I played? The activity I played on the site, was make a t-rex game. What is something I found interesting within the activity? What I found interesting about the game was that I could actually place the coding inside the game, which I could make the dinosaur. And placing obstacles, music, and many more i've been adding within the game. I've understand how complex it is to make your own game and the mechanics within the game. What were the difficulties I had on the acttivity? The difficulties I had when I was working on the activity is that I can't make the dinosaur move, i've been trying to fix the problem. But cant seem to fix it, and I don't know why its not working. So, i'm going to restart from the beginning and do it all over again. So, I suppose it should work again. I restarted the activity, and it worked. I was able to finish the activity.

 What did I found easier, spyro BOLT or python? What I found easier so far during right now was python. How so? Well inside python, you have to use certain words or phrases to move a character to its objective or to an enemy to attack. Unlike spyro BOLT, In order to make a sequence happen, I have to use a lot of coding inside the app in order to make spyro go to a certain point in order to reach the objective. And Whenever doing a different assignment, you'll need lot of more coding in order to succeed. Python just makes it easier to operate and I'd say more fun.

 How did the two approaches help you solve coding challenges? Well in python, in order to start the objective, you have the basics like move left, right, up, and down. And a few more codes. However in spyro BOLT, in order to atleast start the objective, you have to put a lot of coding to make it right or succeed in the assignment.

 How would your day be different without this use of computer science? My day would be slightly ruined a bit. Why? Well, I enjoy using spyro to make events like the virus assignment. And I also like using python, I like how I can play like an RNG game.
