3 sensors found on sphero bolt was that bolt consists of compass, light, and infrared sensors.
One of the 3 sensors im going to pick from sphero BOLT is compass. How does the compass sensor work inside sphero BOLT? Well, it basically works like a regular compass that you probably own. Where sphero can find magnetic north on earth. Sphero bolt will spin and automatically sync to the same offset north that your device is pointed to.
