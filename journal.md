What was the hour code activity I played? The activity I played on the site, was make a t-rex game. What is something I found interesting within the activity? What I found interesting about the game was that I could actually place the coding inside the game, which I could make the dinosaur. And placing obstacles, music, and many more i've been adding within the game. I've understand how complex it is to make your own game and the mechanics within the game. What were the difficulties I had on the acttivity? The difficulties I had when I was working on the activity is that I can't make the dinosaur move, i've been trying to fix the problem. But cant seem to fix it, and I don't know why its not working. So, i'm going to restart from the beginning and do it all over again. So, I suppose it should work again. I restarted the activity, and it worked. I was able to finish the activity.

 What did I found easier, spyro BOLT or python? What I found easier so far during right now was python. How so? Well inside python, you have to use certain words or phrases to move a character to its objective or to an enemy to attack. Unlike spyro BOLT, In order to make a sequence happen, I have to use a lot of coding inside the app in order to make spyro go to a certain point in order to reach the objective. And Whenever doing a different assignment, you'll need lot of more coding in order to succeed. Python just makes it easier to operate and I'd say more fun.

 How did the two approaches help you solve coding challenges? Well in python, in order to start the objective, you have the basics like move left, right, up, and down. And a few more codes. However in spyro BOLT, in order to atleast start the objective, you have to put a lot of coding to make it right or succeed in the assignment.

 # September 30, 2024

 How would your day be different without this use of computer science? My day would be slightly ruined a bit. Why? Well, I enjoy using spyro to make events like the virus assignment. And I also like using python, I like how I can play like an RNG game.

 Right now, in this moment, I'd have to say that I'm feeling alright now. The most stressful part of school lately is the STAAR test. Things I would do or could do when I'm ever trying to relieve my stress is reminding myself that calms me, talking to people I know, and playing video games. One goal I'd like to have for this school year is maintaining my grades at a passing level. And I'm going to stay motivated to achieve this by keeping up with my work. 

# April 7, 2025

How I think AI can help students study for tests like STAAR is AI powered tutroing systems offering real time feedback and explanations, enhancing students understanding on complex subjects. And AI can faciliate collaborative learning environments, which can allow students engage with peers and get support frim virtual study groups. A most useful feature of an AI tutor for me personally is a adaptive learning platforms, AI can analyze students performance and suggest specific practice questions that target needs that may need improvement. I believe I would use this, because this can help direct me into where I would need to imrpove on a subject.

I believe such bans can be detrimental to students, for an example like banning phones in different schools throughout the United States. Banning phones is detrimental to students, as if there a case of emergency, students are unable to use their phone for help.
I'd say this policies would would make the students in a disruptive behavior. This would pose a problem to the students safety. I'd say this would help students focus more into learning, as the students would have less time with their phone. If this policy was implemented at my school, I'd react to this implemented in a negative manner, as I'll need my phone to help me in situtations

Claim- I formly believe that 100 average men could defeat 1 silverback gorilla.

Evidence- The average silverack gorilla wights up to 300 to 420 pounds, while the average male weights 199.8 pounds. With this logic in mind, 100 men would roughly weigh roughly around 19,980 pounds. Also, gorillas lack the stamina compared to a human, as they aren't built for long lasting fight, usually lasting 3-4 minutes. Simply, the men could take this advantage and over power the gorilla. 

Reasoning- This matters, because people want to cause trends, making people argue with one eachother on what would be the correct answer.

Currently, there has been a challenge surfacing online called the "chromebook challenge". Its a trend where it involves inserting objects like pencils into USB ports, which can cause seriously cause fire or even damage to the device. 

Claim - I believe that the "Chromebook Challenge" is a unethical trend that is surfacing online.
Evidence - The new trend, called the "Chromebook Challenge" has now apparently become popular in schools, but this can be a serious problem. For the reason is that students that are sticking objects for example, pencil led into the USB port can cause damage to the chromebook itself. As the chromebook could be broken, but the chromebook could also start smoking, which can cause a fire then maybe explode. This can cause harm to the student and others, this is not a fun and game trend, this is idiotic, because with the students breaking the chromebooks, the school will havee to pay for the damages that the students cause. 
Reason - This goes with my claim, because sticking objects into the chromebook could lead to evaculation of the school, and could have emergency services to deal with the problem. With the destruction of school items, the school would have to pay for it, or even the student's parents would even have to pay for the damages.

What are your thoughts on the new school cell phone law? I have somewhat of mix feelings about the new school cell phone law. Where you aren't able to take out your phone and use it on the axhool grounds. I'm adjusting to this new applied law by putting my phone away. And only using it in breakfeast, since school doesnt start until 7:40. Some challenges for students I'd say is that incase of a emergency, students arent able to check their notifications. And a benefit for a teacher is not worrying about a student not being on their phone.
